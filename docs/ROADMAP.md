# Roadmap — Improving the Learned Driving Policy

Forward plan for raising the policy's driving accuracy/ability, after the obs→action ablation
reframed the project. Living document — update status as items ship.

## Where we are (the reframing finding)
The **direct obs→action policy is our base** — not the world-model latent.

| policy | route | off-road | return | bc_loss | verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **DIRECT-BC** (plain MLP, no WM) | **22%** | 90% | +64 | 0.05 | drives, but drifts off |
| LATENT-BC (WM + actor) | 2% | 0% | +2 | 2.06 | idles (couldn't fit the expert) |
| RANDOM | 2% | 0% | +1.5 | — | baseline |

(`scripts/ablate_direct_bc`, n=10, held-out maps.) The under-trained world-model latent loses the
lane/heading signal, so every latent-based method (BC, DAgger, RL) idled. Cloning directly from the
259-dim state works. **The number to attack is off-road 90% = behavior-cloning distribution shift:**
the policy commits to driving but, having only seen clean centerline demos, can't recover once it drifts.

## Tier 1 — highest leverage (build next)

### A. Recovery data via perturbation  ← ✅ **DONE — it works**
**Result (`scripts/recovery_bc`, n=10 held-out):** clean+recovery vs clean-only →
route **24% → 39%**, crash **20% → 0%**, off-road **50% → 30%**, return +93 → +138, steps 137 → 174.
A real win (gap > the ±11% std). Best learned policy so far; saved `runs/direct_bc/policy_recovery.pt`.

The off-road fix. The policy never learned recovery because it only saw the expert driving cleanly.
Inject perturbations during expert collection (DART; Codevilla §A.3; ChauffeurNet) so the car visits
**off-center states**, and record **IDM's correct action there** as the label — recovery is now *in*
the training set.
- **Mechanism (chosen):** drive the car ourselves; each step query `IDMPolicy.act()` as the clean
  **label**, and *execute* `label + steering perturbation` so the car drifts. (Reuses the proven
  manual-IDM-query from DAgger; avoids touching vehicle pose internals.)
- **Perturbation (Codevilla Eq 3):** triangular steering impulse
  `s(t) = σ·γ·max(0, 1 − |2(t−t₀)/τ − 1|)`, started with prob `p`/step, `σ∈{−1,+1}`, `γ≈0.15`,
  `τ∈[0.5,2]s`. Pure + unit-tested.
- **Train** direct-BC on clean demos **+** recovery demos; eval on held-out. Success = off-road ↓,
  route ↑ vs clean-only.
- Files: `training/recovery.py` (`triangular_impulse`, `collect_idm_perturbed`),
  `scripts/recovery_bc.py` (clean vs clean+recovery comparison).

### B. Eval gauge  ← ✅ **DONE**
- ✅ per-episode variability (`route X%+/-Y%`, `return +/-Z`) — `summarize_driving` + `eval_driving`.
- ✅ **Deterministic fixed eval seeds** — `eval_seeds` + `env.reset(seed=...)` in `_run_episodes`, so
  every eval (eval_driving / recovery_bc / ablate_direct_bc) sees the SAME held-out maps each run.
- ✅ **Targeted recovery metric** — `scripts/eval_recovery.py`: forces the car off-center for the first
  K steps, then measures whether the policy gets back (didn't end off-road). The recovery policy scored
  **recovery_rate 40%** (n=10) — a discriminative isolation of the exact skill A adds.

## Tier 2 — after A shows lift
### C. More + denser demos  ← ✅ **DONE — route plateaus, recovery improves**
`scripts/train_direct_policy.py` — the production trainer (clean + recovery demos, scalable +
tunable perturbation), full held-out eval (route/crash/off-road **and** recovery_rate).
**Result (8k+8k vs 4k+4k, deterministic eval):** route **39% → 39%** (plateau), off-road 30% (same),
but **recovery_rate 40% → 70%** — more data made it *recover* much better, yet aggregate route is
capped at ~39% by the residual off-road. **Takeaway: more demos alone won't break 39%** — the next
lever is D (explicit off-road/progress signal), not scale.

### D. Auxiliary progress head  ← **built; experiment pending**
ChauffeurNet's "more than cloning" idea, adapted to our constraints. We have **no differentiable sim**
(direct policy bypasses the WM), and off-road *classification* labels are too sparse (~99% on-road),
and reward-weighted BC would downweight our recovery examples — so the implementable form is
**Codevilla's auxiliary progress head**: a shared trunk predicts the per-step **reward** alongside the
action (`DirectPolicyAux`, `train_direct_bc_aux`), forcing the representation to encode lane/progress
quality. `train_direct_policy --aux-weight 0.5`. Honest expectation: a regularizer (modest gain), not
a hard off-road penalty. Compare aux vs no-aux at scale (deterministic eval) — running.

## Tier 3 — diminishing returns / more complex
### E. Advanced objectives
- Closed-loop / multi-step rollout loss (penalize *compounding* error, not per-step MSE).
- Action-distribution head (mixture/quantile/diffusion) for a multimodal expert (pass left vs right).
- Input normalization of the 259 dims (lidar/nav/ego live on different scales).

## Honest ceiling
IDM (route 99%) is the teacher, so a clone caps *near* IDM minus distribution-shift losses. Realistic
target: route climbing toward ~50–70%+ and `success_rate` finally > 0% — not 99%. CPU-bound, so keep
budgets modest.

## Deprioritized (the ablation made these not worth it for *policy* accuracy)
- World-model objective swaps (R2-Dreamer / decoder-free TD-MPC2) — we bypass the latent now.
- More DAgger tuning (β-mixing, etc.) — offline perturbation (A) is the simpler recovery source.
- These matter only if we later pursue imagination-based RL, which is not the current path.
